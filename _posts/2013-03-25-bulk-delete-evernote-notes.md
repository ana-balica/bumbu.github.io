I had +1400 notes in Evernote. Now I want them deleted. As I didn'd find any way to do a bulk delete of notes I decided to use the power of available tools: browser and knowledge.
<pre class="language-js"><code>var tryToDelete = function () {
      $('.selectedNoteDelete').first().click()
    }
  , confirmDelete = function () {
      $('#gwt-debug-confirm').click()
    }
  , notes = 100
  , timeout = 1000 // miliseconds
  , loop = function () {
      setTimeout(function(){
        tryToDelete()

        setTimeout(function(){
          confirmDelete()
          notes -= 1
          if (notes &gt; 0)
            loop()
        }, timeout)

      }, timeout)
    }

loop()</code></pre>
<strong>Take care - it will delete your notes and you may be not able to restore them. Also if used not properly it may do any other kind of harm.</strong>

In order to delete notes from a given notebook do:
<ol>
  <li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Open evernote in Google Chrome browser (it should work with any which allows you to run custom JavaScripts)</span></li>
  <li>Open notebook from which you want to delete notes</li>
  <li>Open Console (Ctrl+Shift+j on windows)</li>
  <li>Copy provided code</li>
  <li>Paste it into console</li>
  <li>Change notes and timeout</li>
  <li>Run code</li>
  <li>Wait until it's done</li>
</ol>
Depending on your internet connection, evernote responsiveness and your machine power you may increase or decrease timeout. Â On my machine it was working well with timeout set to 250.

You may change timeout in realtime by passing into console new timeout value:
<code>timeout = 250</code>
In the same way you may check number of items left to delete checking notes value:
<code>notes</code>
In order to stop script (if you introduced to many notes, or something goes wrong and you don't want to refresh page) just run in console:
<code>notes = 0</code>
And back again, if your script finished working, but you need to run it for X more notes, you can write:
<pre class="language-js"><code>notes = 100
loop()</code></pre>
