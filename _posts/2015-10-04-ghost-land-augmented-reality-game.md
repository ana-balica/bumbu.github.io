<strong>Ghost Land</strong> is a virtual reality shooter game. The goal of the game is to shoot as many ghosts before they reach the house.

The game scene is projected on the wall, and a ball is used as a projectile. The ball is tracked using Kinect. The collision point of the ball with the wall is considered to be a shot.
