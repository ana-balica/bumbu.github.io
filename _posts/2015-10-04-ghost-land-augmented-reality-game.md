<strong>Ghost Land</strong> is a real life shooter game. The goal of the game is to shoot as many ghosts before they reach the house.

The game scene is projected on the wall, and a ball is used to shoot. The ball is tracked using a kinect. The collision point of the ball with the wall is the shot.
