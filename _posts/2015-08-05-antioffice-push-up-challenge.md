We decided to make a push-up challenge based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41N6bKO-NVI" target="_blank">Mobby Flower - Bring Sally Up</a>.

The idea is pretty simple:
<ul>
	<li>Start the song</li>
	<li>Every time you hear <em>bring Sally up</em> you do a push-up</li>
	<li>Every time you hear <em>bring Sally down</em> you do a push-down</li>
	<li>When you can't do anymore push-ups - remember the time you stopped and add it to the table (for stats)</li>
</ul>
Our main target is to get through all the song (almost 4 minutes) in one month.

Here are our current results (here time is represented as seconds):
