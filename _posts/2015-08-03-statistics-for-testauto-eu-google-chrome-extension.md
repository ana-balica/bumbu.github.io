You can find the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/statistics-for-testautoeu/ofgammackghonhdfdkknjoihgbjnpcoc" target="_blank">extension here</a>. Or you can read the full story.

<a href="http://testauto.eu/" target="_blank">testauto.eu</a> is the official provider and maintainer of theoretical driver license test in Republic of Moldova. You can prepare for the exam by passing the same exam as during official exam. If you don't pass the test then you'll get explanations for all the wrong answers you gave.

One thing I was missing were statistics. Because there are more then 700 different questions, it is quite hard to remember which ones were answered right and which ones were not. Checking through questions that were answered wrong may dramatically improve success rate and knowledge.

To solve that I created a simple <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/statistics-for-testautoeu/ofgammackghonhdfdkknjoihgbjnpcoc" target="_blank">Google Chrome extension</a> that is tracking entered answers during test. Then at any moment you can go to questions page and see all the questions you answered and answers success rate. The extension is available in English, Romanian and Russian languages (the same as tests).

The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/bumbu/testauto.eu-statistics" target="_blank">GitHub (bumbu/testauto.eu-statistics)</a>.
