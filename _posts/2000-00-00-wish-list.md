_I don't hope to get any of these, but if you're so kind and want to make me a gift - that should save you some time._

* Programmable laser cutter (for paper and thin materials like 1cm thick wood) like this oneÂ [glowforge.com](http://glowforge.com)
* Mini 3D printer (something that can print 10cm x 10cm x 10cm is should do)
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/buy?v=3) licence

If you want to make a postage - send me an email first.
