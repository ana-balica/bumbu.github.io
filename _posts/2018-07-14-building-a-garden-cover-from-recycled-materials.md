> This is a story in pictures of building a garden cover/pergola from scrap wood and fabric.

All in all in numbers:

* Half day of work
* No money spent. List of used materials:
  * Wood - All the wood was found left on the street as garbage
  * Fabric - Used [IKEA curtains](https://amzn.to/2zGlI7k){: target="_blank"} that we had laying around and never used (you can buy them for 10Â£). We sew them together to get one large piece of fabric
  * [Screws](https://amzn.to/2KPbdjm){: target="_blank"} - had some left from [building the garden table](/building-a-garden-table-from-recycled-wood){: target="_blank"}
  * [Wood handsaw](https://amzn.to/2MP0KF0){: target="_blank"} - also bought it when building the garden table
