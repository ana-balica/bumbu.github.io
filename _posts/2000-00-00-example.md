If you ever worked with CSS/HTML then most probably you had the situation when you were supposed to change one thing, but in fact your changes affected other parts of the website (other elements or elements on other pages).

There are many factors that lead to these problems:

* CSS doetn's _have_ modules/namespaces [BEM](https://en.bem.info/)
* Many developers *seem* to ignore
* `run this` changes fast and

## Some code

This code:

```java
public class StringExample
{	public static void main(String[] args)
	{	String s1 = "Computer Science";
		int x = 307;
		String s3 = s2.substring(10,17);

        //showing effect of precedence
        //more examples at http://bumbu.me

		System.out.println("s1: " + s1);
		System.out.println("s2: " + s2);
	}
}
```
{: .line-numbers data-line="12" data-line-offset="7" data-start="8"}

And that code:

```java
public class StringExample
{	public static void main(String[] args)
	{	String s1 = "Computer Science";
		int x = 307;
		String s2 = s1 + " " + x;
	}
}
```
{: data-line="4" data-line-offset="1"}
