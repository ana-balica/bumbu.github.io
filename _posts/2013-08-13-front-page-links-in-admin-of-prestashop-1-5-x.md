The right way to display link in Prestashop is by using methods of Link class. It is often usedÂ <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/1e10dab8f8bf57ce663bb837ca9532f584833acf/classes/Link.php#L455" target="_blank">getPageLink</a> method.

When you need to use this function from admin panel for front controllers - it will not use canonical form. All because Dispatcher object can be initiated in 3 states: front, admin and module. And front controllers' routes are available only when dispatcher is called from front controller.

To overcome this problem you may add a custom <a href="https://gist.github.com/bumbu/6225669" target="_blank">getPageLinkCustom</a> method which will accept as last parameter a controller type.
