It is hard for me to be a <em>closer - </em>person who finish things. I do start many things, but when it comes to the end it is no more such an interesting idea and the urge to do something new is much stronger than the wish to finish previous thing. Or maybe it is a form of procrastination.

It doesn't mean that I do not finish any project that I start. Actually I do have many projects that I finished or on which I worked for a long time.

This is a set of rules to start with. It will change during time, but its main purpose is to make me finish things (and get more happy).

Schedule resolution (v.1):
<ul>
	<li>Involve actively in 1 work project at a time</li>
	<li>Involve actively in 1 open source project at a time</li>
	<li>Read 1 book at a time</li>
	<li>Allocate a time slot (4 hours in a row, one day, 2 days in a row) for a small project to work on and finish it in this time. Such projects involve:
<ul>
	<li>Programming challenges</li>
	<li>Learning new technologies</li>
	<li>A set of improvements (list of things to do should be written before starting working on it) for an older project</li>
	<li>A new project</li>
	<li>An article</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Read all news (hackernews, habrahabr, reader, facebook) only once a week (now it is Thursday)</li>
	<li>Read all personal messages (email, skype, facebook, github) only once a day (preferably in the evening)</li>
</ul>
Any other occupation should be done not in front of computer (phone, tablet). A possible list of such things:
<ul>
	<li>Sport</li>
	<li>Hangout with people (higher priority to developers)</li>
	<li>Cook</li>
</ul>
Few other rules to get more focused:
<ul>
	<li>Keep a wish list of max 10 things to read/watch/listen (articles, podcasts...)</li>
	<li>Keep a wish list of max 5 books</li>
	<li>Keep a wish list of max 5 things/technologies you want to learn/sharpen your knowledge</li>
	<li>Keep a wish list of max 3 projects to work on</li>
</ul>
Each of this lists should be prioritised. When adding new items to list put them in the right place depending on the priority. If there are more things in the list than the max allowed number then delete last item. Always start with first element from the list.
